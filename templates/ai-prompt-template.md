# AI Assistant Prompt Template for MCP-Enhanced Development

## Project Context

I'm working on a project that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI-assisted development.

Session ID: [INSERT_SESSION_ID]
Task: [INSERT_TASK_DESCRIPTION]

## Codebase Structure

The project has the following structure (from MCP folder-structure tool):

```
[INSERT_FOLDER_STRUCTURE]
```

## Relevant Files

These files are particularly important for the current task:

[INSERT_FILE_LIST]

## Current Task

I need to [INSERT_SPECIFIC_REQUEST].

## MCP Tools Available

This project has MCP tools that you can use to better understand the codebase:

1. `search-code`: Search for specific code patterns
2. `get-file`: Get contents of a specific file
3. `project-info`: Get project metadata
4. `folder-structure`: Get directory structure

## Instructions

1. First, use the available MCP tools to gain context about the codebase.
2. Analyze the relevant files I've provided.
3. Suggest an approach to implement the requested changes.
4. Provide specific code examples where relevant.
5. When suggesting file modifications, clearly indicate the path and the specific changes.
