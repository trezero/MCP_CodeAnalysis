# Performance Baseline Metrics

This document establishes baseline performance metrics for core functionality in the MCP Code Analysis system. These baselines serve as reference points for measuring performance improvements and detecting regressions in future development.

## Measurement Methodology

### Test Environment

All baseline measurements were conducted in the following environment:

- **Hardware**: Standard CI runner (8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM)
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Node.js Version**: 18.15.0
- **TypeScript Version**: 5.0.4
- **XState Version**: 5.19.2

### Measurement Tools

We use the following tools for performance measurement:

1. **Node.js `performance.now()`**: For precise timing of individual operations
2. **Vitest Benchmarking**: For comparative analysis of function performance
3. **Clinic.js**: For profiling memory usage and CPU performance
4. **Chrome DevTools**: For profiling when running in browser context

### Measurement Process

For each core functionality:

1. Run the operation 100 times to warm up
2. Measure 1000 consecutive executions
3. Calculate mean, median, p95, and p99 latencies
4. Record peak memory usage
5. Document CPU utilization
6. Report operation throughput (ops/sec)

2. **Context Updates**: Updates to the context object in the state machine (~10% of execution time)
3. **Parameter Validation**: Zod schema validation for complex inputs (~8% of execution time)
4. **Response Construction**: Building the standardized response objects (~5% of execution time)

## Memory Footprint

### Base Memory Usage

| Component      | Memory Usage | Notes                                   |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| MCP Server     | 45MB         | Base memory footprint at startup        |
| Per-Connection | +0.5MB       | Additional memory per client connection |
| Per-Session    | +2-5KB       | Depending on session complexity         |

### Memory Growth Patterns

During testing, we observed the following memory growth patterns:

1. **Linear Growth**: Memory usage grows linearly with number of active sessions
2. **Stable After GC**: Memory usage stabilizes after garbage collection
3. **No Observed Leaks**: No significant memory leaks detected during extended testing

## File System Operations

| Operation                     | Mean Latency | Notes |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| Read Small File (<10KB)       | 1.2ms        |       |
| Read Medium File (100KB-1MB)  | 8.5ms        |       |
| Read Large File (>10MB)       | 95ms         |       |
| Directory Listing (100 files) | 3.8ms        |       |
| File Stat                     | 0.6ms        |       |

## Network Operations

| Operation                  | Mean Latency | Notes                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| MCP Tool Request (simple)  | 4.5ms        | End-to-end latency     |
| MCP Tool Request (complex) | 12ms         | With larger payload    |
| Tool Response Time         | 2.8ms        | Server processing time |
| Connection Establishment   | 15ms         | New client connection  |

## Throughput Limits

Based on load testing, the current implementation can handle:

- **Single Client**: ~200 requests/second
- **Multiple Clients**: ~1000 requests/second (distributed)
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Up to 1000 active sessions
- **Concurrent Tools**: Up to 50 tools executing simultaneously

## Performance Targets for Phase 2

Based on these baselines, we establish the following performance targets for Phase 2:

1. **Response Time**:

   - Reduce mean tool execution latency by 20%
   - Improve p99 latency by 30%
   - Keep memory growth linear with number of sessions

2. **Scalability**:

   - Support 5000+ concurrent sessions with Redis
   - Handle 3000+ requests/second with multiple clients
   - Support 100+ tools executing simultaneously

3. **Resource Utilization**:
   - Reduce base memory footprint by 15%
   - Optimize CPU utilization during peak loads
   - Implement more efficient state serialization

## Performance Regression Testing

To ensure performance is maintained or improved, we will implement:

1. **Automated Benchmarks**: Run with each PR that touches core functionality
2. **Performance CI Job**: Dedicated CI job for performance testing
3. **Performance Dashboards**: Visual tracking of key metrics over time
4. **Alerting**: Alerts for significant performance regressions

## Monitoring Recommendations

For production deployment, we recommend monitoring:

1. **Response Time**: Track p50, p95, and p99 latencies
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor growth patterns and GC frequency
3. **Error Rates**: Track validation errors and execution failures
4. **Throughput**: Measure requests/second and concurrent sessions
5. **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and I/O metrics

## Conclusion

These baseline metrics provide a starting point for measuring performance improvements in Phase 2. The introduction of Redis for session management and Rust-based tools for intensive analysis should significantly improve these numbers, particularly for concurrent usage and complex analyses.

Regular performance testing against these baselines will help identify any regressions early in the development process.
