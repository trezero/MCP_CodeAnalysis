- **Development Workflow**: Branching, testing, and deployment
- **Guided Tours**: Walkthroughs of key code paths
- **Exercises**: Hands-on tasks to build familiarity

### Interactive Elements
- Annotated codebase with explanatory comments
- Step-by-step tutorials with checkpoints
- Interactive diagrams showing system flow
- Sandbox environments for safe experimentation
- Checklists for common tasks
