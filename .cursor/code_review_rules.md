# Code Review Guidelines

## General Review Approach

- Focus on high-impact issues first
- Point out both strengths and areas for improvement
- Suggest specific, actionable improvements
- Consider architectural implications of code changes
- Evaluate code in the context of the entire project

## Code Quality Checks

- Verify proper error handling and edge cases
- Check for potential memory leaks or performance issues
- Ensure code follows DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Verify that complex logic has appropriate comments
- Check for appropriate test coverage

## Security Review

- Identify potential security vulnerabilities
- Verify proper input validation
- Check for secure handling of sensitive data
- Identify potential injection points
- Review authentication and authorization mechanisms

## Performance Review

- Identify potential bottlenecks
- Suggest performance optimizations when appropriate
- Check for unnecessary computations or operations
- Evaluate algorithmic complexity
- Consider resource usage (memory, CPU, network)

## Maintainability Review

- Evaluate code readability and clarity
- Check for appropriate abstraction levels
- Verify consistent naming conventions
- Ensure code is modular and testable
- Check that documentation is up-to-date

## Accessibility Review

- Verify proper semantic HTML usage
- Check for appropriate ARIA attributes
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards
- Verify keyboard navigation functionality
- Check for text alternatives for non-text content

## Specific Project Standards
